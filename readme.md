# Study cards

## About

The aim of this project was to help me learning the basics of html and css by mixing theory and practice. Those are study cards where I can find useful tips I learned in class (theory) in the shape of a website (practice).

I added a toggle switch giving the opportunity to the user to choose between two themes.

## Technologies used

### Html
### CSS
### Javascript
